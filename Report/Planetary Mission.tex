\section{Introduction}
The  PoliMi  Space  Agency  wants  to  launch  a  Planetary  Explorer  Mission,  to  perform  Earth Observation. This section carries out relevant orbital analysis and groundtrack estimation while also considering two perturbation models. A modified groundtrack was proposed for a repeating groundtrack, and two propagation methods are used to perform the analysis which are then compared. A comparison between the real data of a satellite and its analytical results obtained with the code model is also performed for model validity. 

\subsection{Nominal Orbit}

From the provided orbital parameters this satellite heavily resembles a geosynchronous characteristics. Hence, the altitude at perigee is chosen as 35786 km - where it is possible to see the moon and J2 perturbation effect. $\Omega, \omega, \text{ and } f_0$ are chosen arbitrarily.

\section{Groundtrack}
The satellite's orbit is propagated to compute its groundtrack. The motion of the spacecraft is assumed to be a perturbed two body problem in Cartesian coordinates, described by the equation:
\[
\dot{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{\mu}{r^3} \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{a}_{\text{perturbation}}
\]
This is solved using Matlab's \texttt{ode113} function, with a relative tolerance of \(1 \times 10^{-12}\) and absolute tolerance of \(1 \times 10^{-12}\).

\subsection{Unperturbed Nominal Orbit}

The first required analysis of the ground track is for the nominal orbit considering an unperturbed case, where the $\mathbf{a}_{perturbation}$ in equation is null. The ground track was propagated for a period of 1 orbit of the satellite, 1 day and 10 days, as shown below.

The groundtrack of this satellite has formed an "8" shape, a phenomenon known as the figure-eight groundtrack. At geosynchronous altitude, the location after one revolution is the same, and for geostationary  orbits, the satellite always appears to be stationary over one location. The figure “8” occurs because the satellites relative velocity is less and greater, than locations on the Earth as it travels from the ascending node.
