Known the incoming and outcoming heliocentric velocities of the spacecraft it was possible to completely characterize the 
fly by hyperbola in an Earth-centred ecliptic frame. $v_{\infty}^{-}$ and $v_{\infty}^{+}$ will in general be different, so
the gravity assist had to be powered: an impulse $\Delta v_{3}=2.7715 \ 10^{-6}  \ Km/s $ was given at the common pericenter
of the two hyperbolic arcs. All the most relevant parameters are shown in table.
